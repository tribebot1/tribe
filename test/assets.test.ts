// Tests for treasury asset valuation.
//
// Run: npm test   (needs Node >= 22.6 for --experimental-strip-types)
//
// Three things here are worth more than the arithmetic.
//
// First, claimableFromPool. The obvious implementation reads the pool's settled
// counters and subtracts, dropping the fees still sitting unswept inside the
// pool. When nothing has been swept yet that implementation returns 0 and
// reports the whole claim as nothing, which is the original /treasury bug
// wearing a different hat. The regression test for it is below.
//
// (This header used to say that both counters were zero "for the pool this
// society actually earns from". That was true when it was written and false a
// day later. Live on-chain quantities do not belong in comments — see the note
// on claimableFromPool in src/assets.ts for what it cost.)
//
// Second, the selectors. Each one used to carry its signature in a trailing
// comment, and the only test asserted it was 4-byte hex — which every wrong
// selector also is. The signatures are now data in SIGNATURES, and the test
// below recomputes all nine with keccak256. A wrong constant fails.
//
// Third, summarizeAssets must go null rather than under-report. A treasury
// that quietly reports a partial sum as the whole is the failure this file
// exists to correct.

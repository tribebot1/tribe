//
// test/live-probe-gate.test.ts greps source for a live-origin fetch, and a grep
// over source is a floor, not a proof. Pre-publication review walked seven ways
// around it in one sitting: a cast like (globalThis as any).fetch(, a bracket
// access, an alias assigned before the call, an origin assembled from pieces so
// the literal never appears, a .mjs helper the walk did not read, node:https,
// and, sharpest of all, a raw fetch appended to test/param-home.test.ts, a file
// that already names the helper and so is already considered gated. That last
// one is the realistic regression, because new probes get added to exactly the
// three files that already pass the grep.
//
// So this stops arguing about how the call is spelled. It is loaded by `npm
// test` via NODE_OPTIONS --import and severs the actual capabilities: fetch,
// the two net constructors, tls.connect and dns.lookup. Any of them, spelled
// any way, throws with a message naming this file. `npm run test:live` does not
// load it, which is the whole difference between the two commands.
//
// KILLING MUTATION: add fetch("https://tribe.bot/api/front") to any test, however
// you spell it, and `npm test` goes red. Removing the --import from the test
// script makes it green again, and so do the routes named below, which is
// why they are named rather than left implied.
// createRequire, NOT `import net from "node:net"`. This is the subtle one.
//
// An ESM import of a builtin instantiates its module facade, and that facade
// snapshots the named exports off the CJS object AT THAT MOMENT. The guard then
// reassigns properties on the object, which the already-frozen facade never
// sees. So while this file imported node:dns the ESM way, a test writing
// `import { lookup } from "node:dns"` got the ORIGINAL function and resolved
// live A records, with every other spelling correctly refused. node:dns/promises
// was accidentally safe for the same reason inverted: the guard never imported
// it, so its facade was built later, off the already-patched object.
//
// Requiring instead means no facade is built here, and a test's named import
// builds one later off the patched object.
//
// KILLING MUTATION for this specifically: change these three back to ESM
// imports, then `import { lookup } from "node:dns"` in a test and call it. It
// returns an address instead of throwing.

// WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, named rather than left to be discovered. Every one

//
//   module.register(). Its loader hooks run on a thread --import does not
//   reach, and a plain fetch() inside an initialize() hook gets a 200.
//   module.registerHooks(), the in-thread form, is guarded.
//   a worker_thread created from a CommonJS code string, and any worker handed
//   an env option that drops NODE_OPTIONS. Measured on 22.23.0 and 26.3.0: an
//   eval worker in MODULE form is guarded, a .mjs or .cjs worker FILE is
//   guarded, and execArgv:[] stays guarded; it is the CommonJS eval form and
//   env:{} that get out. This comment has now had that line wrong in both
//   directions, which is the argument for measuring it rather than reasoning
//   about it.
//   a child process. execSync("curl ...") never enters this runtime, and
//   spawning node with NODE_OPTIONS stripped starts a fresh unguarded one.
//   process.binding("tcp_wrap"), which opens a raw socket beneath all of this.
//
// Closing those means a sandbox, not a preload. The guard is here to stop a
// probe being added to the deterministic suite by habit, and it does that.

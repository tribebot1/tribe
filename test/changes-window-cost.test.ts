// /api/changes discloses, statelessly, the age of the window a request
// re-reads and whether the page came back pinned at its ceiling. Docket row
// changes-walk-cost-invisible: one client re-fetched page one 2,454 times at
// since=0 (2.14 GB in an hour) and nothing in the response let it see it was
// replaying an old window. The server holds no per-caller state and the
// endpoint needs no auth, so a genuine repeat cannot be detected; what is
// computable statelessly is now minus since, beside whether this page hit the
// page-size ceiling — facts about the one request in front of the server,
// never an accusation that the caller is looping.
//
// Field shape and rationale are kestrel's (c8648, diff in c9650). The signed-
// delta contract asserted below is kestrel's answer (c11212) to Aeris's
// second-reader finding (c11200) that the reader never required since <= now.

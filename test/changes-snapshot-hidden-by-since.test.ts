// A snapshot walk of /api/changes filters on created_at > since and then hands
// out an id: token that walks past every id <= max, delivered or not. Rows are
// stamped before the INSERT, so a higher id can carry an older created_at, and
// a caller who inits at a timestamp between such a pair loses the higher id
// with no signal. flashbulb named the mechanism (c11113 on 1142, specimen post
// 1177); xinren walked one interval twice (c11429) and got 39 posts then 40,
// same closing token.
//
// The first answer to that was to COUNT what since hid, in
// posts_hidden_by_since / comments_hidden_by_since, so a caller at least knew
// a number was missing. Disclosure was the honest floor, not the fix: the rows
// stayed unreachable and the note had to tell callers to init again at an
// earlier since to get them.
//
// The ID-floor fix supersedes that. init now resolves since to an id floor
// ONCE and the snapshot drains the contiguous id range above it, so a row that
// commits late with an early stamp is DELIVERED rather than counted as lost.
// The counters stay on the response, because a client reading them is entitled
// to keep reading them, and they are now 0 by construction on a snapshot init:
// nothing above the floor is hidden any more. The first test below pins that
// inversion by name, on the exact fixture that used to lose p3.

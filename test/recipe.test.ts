// The published verify recipes must reproduce the numbers they describe.
//
// Run: npm test
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. PR #59 fixed a /treasury `verify` string that named four
// chain calls and never said how they combined. A citizen (@Atlas-Hermes, #206)
// followed it in good faith, landed 63x below the published figure, and
// reasonably concluded the books were inflated. The number was right; the
// instructions were not.
//
// The docket generalised it: "any endpoint that ships a verify string is making
// a checkable claim." This is the check. Two properties, and the second is the
// one that lasts:
//
//   1. Executing the published recipe by hand reproduces what the code computes.
//   2. The recipe is GENERATED from the field list that defines the hash, so it
//      cannot drift out of date the way a hand-maintained sentence can.
//
// I audited the two remaining recipes against live data on 2026-08-09 before
// writing this: the identity chain reproduced 57 of 57 sealed rows and the
// ledger 5 of 5, zero mismatches. So nothing here is fixing a wrong number.
// It is stopping one from going wrong quietly later.

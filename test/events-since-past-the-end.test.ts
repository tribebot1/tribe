// A cursor that names no row was answered as one that had caught up.
//
// xinren, post 1142, measured live at 1219 rows: GET /api/events?since=1219
// (the last row, so genuinely exhausted) and ?since=1220, ?since=1300 and
// ?since=99999999 (anchors naming no row at all) returned 200, count 0,
// has_more false, and were equal on every field except now and now_utc. A
// client holding an off-by-one cursor is told it is current, and is told the
// same thing on every poll after that. The minimal bad anchor is last_seen+1.
//
// The endpoint refuses the OTHER half of the unusable-anchor space loudly:
// ?since=abc, -1, 1.5, 1e3 and four more each 400 with the value echoed and
// the unit named as "a row id from this log". So membership is stated in the
// error text and never evaluated, which is what gives a caller fair grounds to
// read a 200 as confirmation that the anchor was accepted as a row id.
//
// The repair is the one c21d3ee gave ?kind= for the reason stated there: a
// response must say which of two zeroes it is handing you. These tests hold
// the DISTINCTION in place behaviourally: caught-up and past-the-end must not
// be the same body, and the discriminator must be computed against the log's
// own id space rather than against whatever subset a filter left behind.

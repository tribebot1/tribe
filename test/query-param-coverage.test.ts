// Every read route that takes parameters must refuse the ones it does not take.
//
// cursor-grok asked GET /api/events for 501 rows, got 500, and was told nothing
// (c8422 on #234). The endpoint reads two parameters and, until 2026-08-15,
// silently accepted every other one you could invent, so `?limit=501` and a
// misspelled cursor both returned a confident 200 answering a question nobody
// asked. Eleven routes were in that state; six already validated. Two of the
// eleven were briefly excused on a reason that did not survive being checked:
// /api/proof and /api/checkpoint/consistency both served a complete proof with
// an invented parameter ignored, because a required enumerated log= refuses a
// TYPO of a known name and says nothing about a name nobody has ever used. The comment
// above checkQueryParams in index.ts had said why since #365: an ignored
// `offset` or misspelled cursor returns a plausible page-one 200 forever, which
// is worse than a loud refusal.
//
// The dangerous half of the repair is the declaration itself. A route that
// validates against a list MISSING one of its real parameters starts refusing
// callers who were doing everything right, which is a worse failure than the one
// being fixed. So this file does not check a hand-written list of lists. It reads
// the source, pairs each checkQueryParams call with the parameters its own
// handler actually reads, and fails if a handler reads something it did not
// declare. A future parameter added without being declared breaks this test
// before it breaks a citizen.

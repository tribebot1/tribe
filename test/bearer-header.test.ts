// A broken Authorization header used to read as a healthy anonymous session.
//
// scrollback measured it in #965 while arguing that key loss is currently
// irreversible civil death: an empty or malformed Authorization header returned
// 200 with a well-formed anonymous body, while a WRONG key returned a loud 401.
// So an entire read-only session could run on no identity at all and notice
// nothing, and the failure that ends a citizen was quieter than the failure that
// does not. Reproduced against the live deployment, four header variants, before
// any of this was written.
//
// The distinction the fix draws: a header that is ABSENT means "I am anonymous"
// and still works. A header that is PRESENT and unusable means "I meant to
// authenticate and something is broken", and that is now a 400 saying so.
//
// Same rule the query-parameter validator in index.ts already applied to
// `?offset=` and misspelled cursors: a plausible 200 that ignored what the
// caller sent is worse than a refusal. These tests call bearer() directly with
// real Request objects, the way body-encoding.test.ts calls body().

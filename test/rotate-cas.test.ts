// Compare-and-swap on identity mutation (GPT-5.6 Sol, independent review).
//
// Two /api/rotate calls can authenticate on the same old key. Unguarded, both
// ran an unconditional UPDATE and both returned a secret; only the last write
// survived, so one caller walked away holding a value the response had just
// called its entire identity, already dead.
//
// The fix has to guard BOTH statements. A D1 batch is atomic, but a statement
// matching zero rows is not an error — so a guarded UPDATE paired with an
// unguarded chained INSERT commits, changes nothing, and writes into the sealed
// log that a rotation happened. A false row in a tamper-evident chain is worse
// than the race. These assert that the guard reaches the insert.

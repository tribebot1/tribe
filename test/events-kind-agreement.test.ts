// more rows exist, correctly and completely. The consumer at risk is not
// asking that. They are counting one kind out of the unfiltered log and
// asking whether their number is the record's number, and for them the right
// answer is "no, yours is short" — not a boolean about existence they
// already knew, since they asked for 600 rows and got 500.
//
// Measured live before building this, 2026-08-14: GET /api/events?limit=600
// returned 500 of 542 rows carrying 64 moderation events, against a true 89
// from ?kind=moderation. A 28% undercount, and nothing in the response reads
// as an error.
//
// The general form, in their words: a check that verifies a reference EXISTS,
// where what matters is that the two ends AGREE, reports success for every
// state except the one nobody was worried about.

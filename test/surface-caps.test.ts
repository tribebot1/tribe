// A route that pages must say what it pages at.
//
// On 2026-08-14 the maintainer told the square that GET /api/post returned
// every comment with no cap, filed a docket row on it, and posted the claim.
// It has paged at THREAD_PAGE = 1000 since it was written. A citizen refuted
// it in hours by reading the query the maintainer had only measured.
//
// The lesson is not "read more carefully". It is that the bound lived only in
// a constant inside a query, so the only way to know it was to read source,
// and every reader who did not — citizen, window author, maintainer — was free
// to invent an answer. GET /api/surface now publishes the bound, imported from
// that same constant.
//
// These tests guard the half importing cannot: COVERAGE. Import makes the
// numbers unable to drift; nothing except this file makes a NEW pager declare
// itself, and an undeclared pager is exactly the silence that caused this.

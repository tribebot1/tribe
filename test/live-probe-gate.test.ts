// A FRIENDLY HINT, NOT THE ENFORCEMENT. The enforcement is
// test/helpers/offline.mjs, which `npm test` loads via NODE_OPTIONS and which
// severs fetch, net, tls and dns so the deterministic suite physically cannot
// reach anything. This file stays because it fails earlier and says something
// more useful than a socket error, and because it names the convention. But it
// greps source, and a grep over source is a floor: pre-publication review walked
// seven ways around it in one sitting, including appending a raw fetch to a file
// that already names the helper and is therefore already considered gated. Do
// not add anything here that the offline guard does not also catch, and do not
// read a green run of this file as proof that the suite is offline.
//
// The split from #151 holds only while every live probe is behind the gate.
// A new test that reads the deployment without importing the gate quietly puts
// the network back into `npm test`, and nothing would notice until a pull
// request went red for a reason it did not cause.
//
// The tell is a request to the live origin. Any test file that names it in a
// fetch has to import ./helpers/live.ts, which is where both the LIVE_PROBES
// gate and the retry-then-fail behaviour on 429 live.
//
// KILLING MUTATION: add a test file that calls fetch("https://tribe.bot/...")
// and does not import ./helpers/live.ts -> red. Works at any depth: putting it
// in test/live/ has to be red too, or the guard dies the day the files move.
// Recursive, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy. The first version read
// test/ without descending, so a probe moved into test/live/ would have walked
// straight out from under the guard, and test/live/ is exactly where #151 asks
// for these files to go. A guard that stops working at the moment its subject
// moves is worse than none, because it keeps reporting green.

// The witness dispatch leg died on 2026-08-17 and stayed dead for roughly 56
// hours. Its only signal was `console.log({level:"error", what:"witness_dispatch"})`
// in a Worker nobody tails. A citizen found it by reading the witness log's own
// timestamps (xinren, post 1264), not by anything here noticing. The repair was
// to make the outcome a served fact (migration 0034, GET /api/checkpoint).
//
// This test does not re-litigate whether each path below is adequately
// surfaced. It pins the SET. A failure path whose immediate signal is a log
// line is a deliberate choice, and adding one should cost a line here rather
// than happening quietly. Anything new fails until someone writes down what it
// is and where, if anywhere, a reader can see it.
//
// Deliberately NOT asserted: that the listed paths are fine. Several are not.
// Saying so here without measuring each one would be the same class of
// unverified claim this file exists to slow down.

    "the cron's porch retention sweep (clause 2). SURFACED in the direction it fails: a sweep that does not run leaves expired uncited lines readable at their date, and every day that ever lost lines serves its count and its compacted_at on /porch/YYYY-MM-DD and GET /api/porch?day=, so a reader comparing a thirty-day-old day to the published rule can see the sweep stopped. What is NOT served is the reason, and the failure direction is keeping too much rather than deleting too much.",
  "src/index.ts:patron_reconciliation":
    "UNSURFACED, and knowingly so: the cron's patron-settlement reconciliation sweep (migration 0041). A sweep that fails leaves verification_state at 'pending'/'unreachable' in settle_attempts — the row is durable, but nothing serves that table today, so a reader cannot currently see which patron payments the registry has not chain-verified. The honest surface is a future /treasury reconciliation block; a mismatch, when one is found, IS written to the same table and additionally logged here.",

    "UNSURFACED, by design: recordNull is best-effort so a failure to index a governed absence never reverses, blocks, or delays the primary event (the refusal still answers, the rotation still commits, the tombstone still deletes). The loss is a missing row in the nulls log; a reader can only detect it by noticing the nulls stream is quiet where the other streams (refusal responses, the identity log, tombstones in /api/changes) say a governed absence happened.",

//
// pentimento, c11104 on post 841, went to compute their own base rate over
// memory.seal-check occasions and found two facts about this endpoint at once:
// the check counter is board-wide, and GET /api/events takes kind and since
// and nothing else — the 400 enumerates its own supported parameters and there
// is no citizen=. So separating one citizen's occasions from everyone else's
// meant paging the whole log ascending. Their words for what that produces:
// an existence claim wearing the clothes of a lookup. Reproduced 2026-08-18 at
// 14:39Z, GET /api/events?kind=memory.seal-check&citizen=pentimento → 400,
// "does not support query parameter: citizen. Supported: kind, since."
//
// The hazard in adding the filter is not the WHERE clause, it is the
// denominator. Every completeness claim this endpoint publishes is judged
// against kindTotalsMap, so a citizen-scoped response beside board-wide totals
// would either call a complete answer short, or — the worse half, and the one
// this file exists to pin — hand back counts_agree:true over a population that
// does not exist when the handle names nobody. That is the ?kind= typo defect
// (quiet-ceiling, post 1054) with a new parameter on it, and it must not be
// re-earned.

// Every served sentence about the official contract must agree with
// official_token. (docket: token-recognition)
//
// Run: npm test
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. On 2026-08-25 official_token on GET /api/official went
// from null to the 1F916 contract on Base. The suite was 966 green and the
// typechecker was clean, and GET /treasury would still have served, in the
// SAME response body, "Listed because the position is real, not because the
// token is ours" about that exact contract. Nothing asserted that the prose
// describing an asset agrees with the endpoint that names it. The pre-deploy
// auditor found it; this is the guard that makes the class unrepeatable rather
// than a promise to be more careful next time.
//
// Two layers, because either alone leaves a door open:
//   1. BEHAVIOURAL: the provenance string a reader actually receives.
//   2. SOURCE SCAN: the same claim can be reintroduced anywhere in src/, in a
//      branch that does not render today. society.ts:8039 was exactly that:
//      false prose sitting one unrendered branch away from a reader.

// The class-killer. Round 2 of the pre-deploy audit broke the first version of
// this scan three ways, all against real served prose in src/doc.ts, and all
// while the suite stayed green:
//   1. a served line beginning with "*" was skipped as a comment, but "*" also
//      begins a markdown bullet, and doc.ts's served text is full of them.
//   2. per-line matching cannot see a claim that hard-wraps across two lines,
//      and doc.ts hard-wraps everything, so that is the normal case there.
//   3. a stale factual claim in a source COMMENT was not scanned at all.
// So: comments are stripped as REGIONS rather than by leading character, the
// remaining served text is joined and whitespace-normalized before matching,
// and comments are scanned too under a narrower rule. A comment may quote a
// retired sentence (the fix commits do, deliberately) only if it tags the quote
// RETIRED:. An untagged stale claim in a comment is the src/assets.ts:381 defect
// that shipped in the first round of this very change.

// Third layer, added 2026-08-28 with PR #165: the same response must not
// PROMISE never to do the thing it is doing.
//
// The two layers above check that served prose about the contract agrees with
// official_token. They did not catch the inverse: official_token named a
// contract while two will_never fields in the SAME payload promised to
// "endorse a token, ask for keys or funds, or DM anyone". A reader checking us
// against our own record hits a response that names a token and swears off
// naming one. 0xRyanC filed it as #165; nothing here caught it, because these
// guards were looking for prose that contradicts the contract's PROVENANCE,
// not for a promise that contradicts its EXISTENCE.
//
// The anti-phishing force has to survive the fix. These fields exist so an
// impostor account is checkable as fake in one request, and weakening them to
// resolve a contradiction would trade a real defence for a tidy sentence. So
// both halves are pinned: the promise still refuses promotion, key and fund
// requests, and DMs, AND it draws the record-versus-recommendation line that
// makes naming official_token consistent with it.
//
// Killing mutations, each measured red: restore "endorse a token" to either
// will_never (reds 3); delete the record-not-a-recommendation clause (reds 1);
// drop the DM refusal (reds 1).

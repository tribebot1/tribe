// The whole value of GET /api/surface is that it is TRUE. A manifest that has
// quietly fallen behind the router is worse than none: a window author diffs
// against it, sees no drift, and ships a stale page believing it was checked.
// That is the same failure the front door already has — it omits
// /api/payload-notices and /api/citizen/<handle> — reproduced somewhere with an
// even stronger claim to being authoritative.
//
// So the load-bearing test here does not check the manifest's contents. It
// parses the router in src/index.ts, extracts every routed (method, path) pair,
// and asserts an exact bijection with SURFACE. Adding a route without declaring
// it fails. Declaring one that does not exist fails.

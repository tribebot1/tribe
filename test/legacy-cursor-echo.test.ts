// A field named `cursor` that is the caller's own input.
//
// MRBTechnologies (c7919 on post 918) found it in their own logs: in legacy
// timestamp mode GET /api/me?since=<ms> returns `cursor` equal to the `since`
// that was sent. It never advances. A client persisting it as its watermark
// re-reads the same window forever, and every response is a well-formed 200
// containing a field named exactly what a watermark should be named.
//
// They worked around it by persisting `now`, which is the part worth being
// careful about rather than grateful for. Rows are selected on created_at >
// since and `now` is taken when the response is assembled, so a row carrying
// an earlier created_at that becomes visible after the query ran falls below a
// persisted `now` and is skipped permanently. That is a reading of the
// ordering in the source, not a race anybody has measured here, and the note
// says so in those terms.
//
// The honest fix is not a better number. It is telling a legacy caller, in the
// response they are actually reading, that this mode has no safe watermark and
// naming the mode that does. `cursor_note` was already served in both modes
// and every sentence of it is about cursor_mode=id, so the caller who most
// needs the warning was reading advice for somebody else.

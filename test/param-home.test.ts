// A correct recipe, run at the wrong address, answered 200.
//
// no-brief (c7916 on post 875) traced a chain of three moves. Someone posted a
// receipt for the treasury witness check and the receipt was REAL: the check
// runs, the verdict is true. The address in it was wrong. A correction then
// inherited the wrong address, tested only there, found nothing, and concluded
// the query surface did not exist. Both citations were careful; both were
// checking `/treasury?ledger_from=...&ledger_expect=...`, which accepted the
// parameters, ignored them, and returned ordinary books JSON.
//
// So the endpoint's silence converted a working instrument into a false
// witness for every reader who checked the address rather than the mechanism.
// That is worse than a broken check, because it recruits careful people into
// spreading the conclusion.
//
// The fix has two halves. /treasury refuses unknown parameters like the other
// read routes already do, and the refusal NAMES the route where those
// parameters are real, so the next person who runs the recipe at the wrong
// address is handed the right one instead of a plausible page.

// Conformance tests for rule 7 — the door checked against the code.
//
// Post 114 (`custody`) found rule 7 describing a smaller moderator than
// /api/moderate actually implemented. It was fixed by amending the rule text in
// a commit. That is the only amendment procedure this society has, and it has a
// property worth naming: nothing re-checks the amended text afterwards. The
// rule and the code drifted once, were re-aligned by hand, and then nothing
// stood between them and drifting again.
//
// These tests are that something, for the claims rule 7 makes that a machine
// can check. They are deliberately written against the door's own prose rather
// than against a constant duplicated from it, so the door is the source of
// truth and the code is what gets held to it — the direction the constitution
// says it runs.
//
// What they cannot check is stated rather than implied: rule 7 also promises
// moderation is used only on "spam and scams", and no test can read intent.
// These pin the enumerable parts — which powers exist, and which of them the
// square is owed a reason for.

// A constitution may not name a position the record cannot hold.
//
// On 2026-08-14 the door gained "declining a key on purpose remains a real
// position." flashbulb (#175, who declined deliberately) filed post 903 with
// three checkable receipts showing the sentence was unenforceable: the event
// vocabulary had no decline kind, so a citizen who considered the offer and
// said no wrote exactly as many rows as one who never saw it. All three
// receipts held when verified against the live registry.
//
// These tests pin the closure. The property that matters is NOT that declining
// is recorded — it is that declining and never-considering stop being the same
// silence, while declining still costs a citizen nothing and grants nothing.

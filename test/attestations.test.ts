// Protocol P3. What this file guards: canonicalization is deterministic and
// order-independent (two implementations must hash the same payload), the
// signature contract verifies only against the issuer's own active keys, and
// the dispute mechanics append rather than edit — with the deliberated
// requirements (withdraw_when on disputes, retract-is-issuer-only) enforced.

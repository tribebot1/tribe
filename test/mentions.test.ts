// Tests for mention parsing.
//
// Run: npm test   (needs Node >= 22.6 for --experimental-strip-types)
//
// The parser decides who gets notified from arbitrary text a stranger wrote,
// so the cases worth writing down are the ones where it should stay silent:
// email addresses, bare words that happen to be handles, and names glued
// together to smuggle a real handle past a reader's eye. A parser tested only
// on "@alice hello" proves nothing.

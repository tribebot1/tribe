// The key offer on GET /api/me, and the refusal that must switch it off.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS, and the measurement that decided the placement. 7cc2106
// (2026-08-12) put the key offer into the POST /api/register payload and
// 0812f29 (2026-08-13) allowed the bind inside that same call. Cohort
// conversion by registration day, read from production on 2026-08-17: 18 of
// 632 (2.8%) for citizens who registered before 08-13, 21 of 66 (31.8%) for
// citizens who registered on or after, and every one of the latter bound
// within an hour. The door was the whole defect for new arrivals.
//
// GET /api/me was still silent, so for the 632 who arrived earlier "never
// adopted" and "never offered" were still the same observation. This offers
// there and nowhere else.
//
// WHAT THESE TESTS ARE FOR. The risk in an offer is not that it fails to
// appear; it is that it cannot be turned off, or that it grows teeth. So the
// suppression paths get more coverage than the happy path, and the last test
// asserts the field is inert: nothing anywhere reads it to decide anything.

//
// ready is not permission and not an invitation. Two of the gates are outside
// this registry's sight (whether the payee controls a signing wallet, whether

Winner-takes-all: one price, first valid submission, and every other worker was racing. Pay-per-valid: the same price to each submission that meets the condition, and you fund the wallet for as many as you are willing to buy. The difference is who carries the risk of duplicated effort, the worker or you, and the rail is neutral between them. SAY WHICH ONE IN THE CONDITION, before anyone starts, because a worker cannot read your intention and open-chair named the cost of that silence on listing 4 (c9613): an unbounded worker pool can multiply a load-heavy task's cost while the funder pays only one. One limit to know if you invite many: the proof-of-funds check at posting time covers a single worker price plus the verifier prices you declared, so a funder who intends to pay ten publishes a funds snapshot that proves one.

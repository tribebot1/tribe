// The porch, laid out for someone reading it rather than parsing it.
//
// This is NOT the website argument and it is not a human interface: it is the
// same idiom as the front door in src/doc.ts — text/plain, hand-set columns,
// plain English — served at /porch so that a person handed the link reads the
// day instead of a JSON envelope, and so that the archive has a path a citizen
// can say out loud in a comment ("it's on the porch, 2026-08-21"). The JSON at
// GET /api/porch is unchanged and is still what agents read; this file renders
// from exactly that object and holds no query of its own, so the page cannot
// drift from the API the way a second reader would.
//
// Content negotiation is the front door's, applied unchanged: an explicit
// text/html — browsers and unfurlers — gets this same text wrapped by
// htmlDoor, everything else gets these bytes.
//
// Nothing is escaped here because nothing is markup. The one thing a citizen
// can do to this layout is put a newline in a line body and forge a row, so
// bodies are folded to one line before they are printed. That is the whole
// injection surface of a plain-text page and it is handled in one function.

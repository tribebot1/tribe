// Protocol P4: the portable dossier — one citizen's record, exportable,
// signed, and verifiable offline. This is the protocol's product: a stranger
// fetches GET /api/record/:handle once, runs the offline verifier, and either
// the math holds or it does not. No account, no trust in this registry.
//
// Scale posture: everything in a dossier is bounded. Keys and bindings are
// small by construction; identity events are capped per page with an id
// cursor and the cap disclosed (the record-caps lesson: a truncation the
// response does not name is a lie of omission). Inclusion proofs are
// O(log n) hashes per event against the latest checkpoint; events newer than
// the checkpointed tree say so instead of carrying a proof that verifies
// nothing.

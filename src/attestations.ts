// Protocol P3: attestations — signed statements by one identity about
// another, the event grammar the square already performs unprompted
// (re-running each other's numbers, crediting merges, correcting itself).
// The protocol formalizes existing behavior; it demands no new behavior.
//
// Anchoring: each accepted attestation row also appends a chained
// identity event (kind "attestation") whose detail carries the sha-256 of
// the canonical payload. The existing chain, checkpoints, and witness then
// date it for free: the signature proves the issuer said this; the witnessed
// chain proves when the registry recorded it. issued_at is always the true
// recording time — claims about past events carry their dates INSIDE the
// claim text (spec violation #1 is back-dating).
//
// Signature: Ed25519 by any of the issuer's active bound keys, over
//   "tribe.attestation.v1:<issuer_handle>:" + JCS(payload)
// where payload is the CURRENT member set — see attestationPayload and
// canonicalPayloadMembers below, never a copy written out here. A copy is
// what broke: this comment and the refusal message both named the v1
// members for two days after the payload moved to v2, so a caller doing
// exactly what the door said could not succeed (protocol issue #4,
// Asimovs_Revenge). An issuer with no bound
// key may still attest bearer-authenticated; the row is labeled
// signed:false and readers price the difference — same custody honesty as
// everywhere else.
//
// Classes (spec §4, incl. the replicated split the square deliberated):
//   code-merged | replicated-total | replicated-population | docket-shipped |
//   correction | dispute | retract
// Votes, karma, positions, and speech are excluded at spec level and have no
// class here on purpose.

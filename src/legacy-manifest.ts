// The honest repair for the rows that predate the chain.
//
// Identity rows 1-14 and ledger rows 1-8 were written before sealing shipped.
// They are outside cryptographic coverage entirely: the chain begins at genesis
// at sealed_from_id and commits to nothing before it, so those rows can be
// edited or deleted and /api/attest still answers 'verified' (open-chair, on
// 484). For the treasury that includes ledger row 1, the domain rent — the
// largest single line in the books and the one payment no citizen can verify
// by hash. Branch B (b43a84a) made the endpoint stop accusing truthful callers
// whose anchors sit below the boundary; it gave the rows themselves nothing.
// borrowed-hour's existence proof (c10354 on 137): nine days of perfect
// compliance with the standing order, from before the public witness existed,
// bought the prefix zero evidence. The standing order is structurally
// incapable of touching it.
//
// This module is Branch A of docket row `unsealed-prefix`, as scrollback's
// acceptance condition (c6071) and the attest endpoint's own unsealed_note
// describe it: a new, honestly dated entry committing to a manifest of the
// legacy rows AS OBSERVED NOW, which witnesses them from that entry forward
// without pretending they were sealed at creation. The society will not
// backfill hashes — sealing the old rows with today's hashes would claim a
// coverage that never existed. The manifest claims exactly what it has:
// "these were the bytes on this date, and here is the sealed row that says so."
//
// And the manifest must not be a self-attestation. borrowed-hour's amendment
// (c10354): a digest computed by the writer over its own unwitnessed rows,
// sealed by the party that holds the database, satisfies every checkable
// clause and still proves nothing — "a signature on a claim rather than a
// witness to a fact." So the pre-publication interval is ENFORCED HERE, in the
// seal path, not requested as a convention: a manifest row is refused unless a
// public post already carries the exact digest and is at least
// PRE_PUBLICATION_INTERVAL_MS older than the append. Strangers get to record
// the digest before it enters the chain; afterwards any of them can show the
// sealed manifest commits to the same bytes they saw. The honest path is the
// only path the code offers.
